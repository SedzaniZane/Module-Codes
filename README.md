PROJECT TITLE: Module Code Validations
This assignment involves implementing validation, determining major based on specific criteria, describing year level, and managing user input through loops until valid data is provided.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:This assignment involves implementing validation, determining major based on specific criteria, describing year level, and managing user input through loops until valid data is provided.
VERSION or DATE:07 March 2024
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
It starts with :
Input Requirement: The program's main method expects a string input which is a student's subject code (e.g., CMPG211).
Then Implement a method named isValid() that checks if the input string is valid according to specific criteria.
Create a method called determineMajor() that takes the first character of the valid input and determines the major based on it.
Then Implement determineYearLevel() which takes the first digit of the valid input. And then it returns a description of the year level of a student based on the digit.
Followed by an execution flow through a loop that prompts users to input the subject codes until its valid. Done By 
The isValid() method must confirm the validity of the input before determineMajor() and determineYearLevel() can be called.
Use a loop in the main method to continuously prompt the user to input the subject code until it is valid.
